# Minnesota Paid Leave

Minnesota's Paid Leave program provides eligible employees with partial wage replacement when they need to take time off for qualifying reasons. MKC Restaurants participates in the state-run plan administered by the Minnesota Department of Employment and Economic Development (DEED).

## Eligibility

You are eligible for Minnesota Paid Leave benefits if you have earned at least **$3,900** in wages in the 12 months before your leave begins. This amount can come from one job or be combined from multiple jobs.

Nearly all employees are covered, including full-time, part-time, and seasonal workers.

## Qualifying Reasons

You may apply for Paid Leave benefits for the following reasons:

**Medical leave** (up to 12 weeks):

- Your own serious health condition, including pregnancy and recovery from childbirth

**Family leave** (up to 12 weeks):

- Bonding with a newborn, newly adopted child, or newly placed foster child
- Caring for a family member with a serious health condition
- Safety leave related to domestic abuse, sexual assault, or stalking — for yourself or a family member
- Qualifying exigency related to a family member's military deployment

**Family member** is defined broadly under this program and includes your spouse, child, parent, sibling, grandchild, grandparent, and parent-in-law.

## How Much Leave

You may take up to **12 weeks of medical leave** and up to **12 weeks of family leave** in a 52-week period, with a **combined maximum of 20 weeks**.

## Benefit Amount

Minnesota Paid Leave provides **partial wage replacement** — not your full pay. Your benefit amount is calculated based on your average weekly wage. The maximum weekly benefit is set by the state each year.

## How to Apply

Paid Leave benefits are applied for through the state, not through MKC Restaurants. To file a claim:

1. Notify your manager that you will be taking leave
2. Apply at **paidleave.mn.gov** or by phone at **651-556-7777** (toll free: 844-556-0444)
3. The state will process your claim and issue payments directly to you

## Premium Contributions

The program is funded through payroll premiums shared between MKC Restaurants and employees. The current premium rate is **0.88%** of wages (up to the Social Security wage cap, currently $185,000), split equally — **0.44%** employer and **0.44%** employee. Your share is deducted automatically from your paycheck.

## Coordination with FMLA

If your leave qualifies under both Minnesota Paid Leave and the [Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA)](fmla.md), the two will run concurrently. FMLA provides job protection, while Minnesota Paid Leave provides wage replacement. You may be using both programs at the same time.

## Coordination with Employer-Provided Leave

You may use your accrued PTO or Sick & Safe Time to supplement your Paid Leave benefit, up to your regular wages. You cannot receive more than your normal pay by combining benefits.

## Job Protection

If you have worked for MKC Restaurants for at least **90 days**, you are entitled to return to the same or equivalent position after your Paid Leave ends. Your health and dental benefits will continue during your leave on the same terms as if you were actively working.

## No Retaliation

MKC Restaurants will not interfere with or retaliate against any employee for requesting or using Minnesota Paid Leave benefits. Employers cannot take your Paid Leave payments. If you believe your rights have been violated, report it to any manager or directly to ownership. You may also contact the Labor Standards Division at the Minnesota Department of Labor and Industry.
