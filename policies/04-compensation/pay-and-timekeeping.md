# Pay Periods & Timekeeping

## Pay Schedule

MKC Restaurants pays employees on a **bi-weekly** basis. Each pay period covers two weeks, running from Monday through the second Sunday. Paychecks are issued on the Friday following the end of each pay period.

If a payday falls on a holiday, you will typically be paid on the preceding business day.

## Direct Deposit

We encourage all employees to enroll in direct deposit. Direct deposit ensures your pay is available on payday without needing to pick up or deposit a physical check.

To set up or change direct deposit, contact management for assistance.

## Timekeeping Requirements

Accurate timekeeping is essential. All non-exempt (hourly) employees must clock in and out using TOAST.

**You are required to:**

- Clock in when you begin work (not before)
- Clock out when you finish work
- Clock out for unpaid meal breaks if applicable
- Clock back in when returning from breaks

**You must NOT:**

- Clock in before your scheduled start time without manager approval
- Have another employee clock in or out for you
- Work off the clock for any reason

## Missed Punches

If you forget to clock in or out, notify your manager immediately. Your manager will correct the time record. Repeated missed punches may result in disciplinary action.

## Time Record Review

Review your time records regularly through 7shifts. If you believe there is an error in your hours or pay, report it to your manager right away. We will investigate and correct any errors promptly.

## Payroll Deductions

Your paycheck will reflect deductions required by law (federal and state taxes, Social Security, Medicare) and any voluntary deductions you have authorized (such as benefits contributions).

MKC Restaurants will not make improper deductions from your pay. If you believe a deduction was made in error, report it immediately and it will be corrected.
