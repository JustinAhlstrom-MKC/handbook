# Injury Reporting & Workers' Compensation

Your safety is our priority. If you are injured at work, it's important to report the injury and seek appropriate care right away.

## If You Are Injured at Work

1. **Get medical attention** - For serious injuries, call 911 or go to the emergency room immediately. For minor injuries, use the first aid kit and inform your manager.

2. **Report the injury** - Notify your manager as soon as possible, regardless of how minor the injury seems. All workplace injuries must be documented.

3. **Complete an incident report** - Your manager will help you complete an incident report detailing what happened, when, where, and any witnesses.

4. **Seek follow-up care if needed** - If you need medical treatment beyond first aid, inform your manager. Workers' compensation may cover your medical expenses.

## Workers' Compensation

MKC Restaurants carries workers' compensation insurance as required by Minnesota law. If you are injured on the job:

- Medical expenses for work-related injuries may be covered
- You may be entitled to wage replacement if you miss work due to the injury
- You have the right to file a workers' compensation claim

We will provide you with the necessary claim forms and information if you are injured. Retaliation against employees for filing workers' compensation claims is prohibited.

## Reporting Requirements

**All injuries must be reported, even if:**
- The injury seems minor
- You don't think you need medical attention
- You're not sure if it happened at work

Early reporting helps ensure you receive proper care and protects your rights under workers' compensation.

## Return to Work

If you miss work due to a workplace injury, we will work with you and your healthcare provider on a return-to-work plan. This may include modified duties or a gradual return to full responsibilities.

## Questions

If you have questions about workers' compensation or injury reporting, contact your manager or ownership.
