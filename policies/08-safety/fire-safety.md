# Fire Safety

Kitchen fires are one of the most serious risks in a restaurant. Every team member must understand how to prevent fires, respond if one occurs, and evacuate safely. This policy covers the essentials — review it carefully, and ask your manager if anything is unclear.

**All employees are required to review this policy every six months as part of our ongoing fire safety training.**

## Fire Prevention

The best response to a fire is preventing one. Follow these practices every shift:

- **Keep cooking areas clean.** Grease buildup on equipment, hoods, and surfaces is a leading cause of kitchen fires. Clean as you go.
- **Never leave cooking equipment unattended** while in use, especially fryers and open flames.
- **Keep flammable materials away from heat sources.** This includes towels, paper products, cardboard, aprons, and cleaning chemicals.
- **Report equipment problems immediately.** Malfunctioning burners, frayed cords, or faulty pilot lights are fire hazards.
- **Store chemicals properly.** Keep flammable products in designated areas, away from heat and cooking equipment.
- **Do not block fire exits, extinguisher access, or hood suppression system controls.**

## Types of Kitchen Fires

Understanding the type of fire determines the correct response:

- **Grease/oil fires (Class K)** — The most common and dangerous kitchen fire. Caused by overheated cooking oil or grease igniting. **Never use water on a grease fire** — water causes grease fires to explode and spread.
- **Electrical fires (Class C)** — Caused by faulty wiring, overloaded outlets, or damaged equipment.
- **Ordinary combustible fires (Class A)** — Paper, wood, cardboard, or cloth fires.

## If a Fire Starts

### Small, Contained Fires

1. **Stay calm.** Alert nearby team members.
2. **Turn off the heat source** if you can do so safely.
3. **For small grease fires on the stovetop:** Slide a metal lid or sheet pan over the pan to smother the flames. Never move the pan.
4. **Use the correct extinguisher** if the fire is small and you are trained:
    - **Class K extinguisher** (silver label) for grease/oil fires — these are mounted near cooking stations
    - **ABC extinguisher** (red) for general fires
5. **Use the P.A.S.S. technique:**
    - **P**ull the pin
    - **A**im at the base of the fire (not the flames)
    - **S**queeze the handle
    - **S**weep side to side
6. **If the fire does not go out within a few seconds, stop and evacuate.**

### Larger Fires or Hood Suppression Activation

1. **Activate the hood suppression system** if it has not triggered automatically. The manual pull station is located near each cooking line — know where yours is.
2. **Evacuate immediately.** Do not attempt to fight a fire that has spread beyond a single point.
3. **Call 911** once you are safely outside.
4. **Account for all team members and guests** at the designated assembly point.

## Evacuation

- **Know your exits.** Every location has multiple emergency exits. Familiarize yourself with all of them, not just the one you normally use.
- **Know the assembly point.** Your manager will identify the outdoor meeting location for your location.
- **Help guests exit calmly.** Direct guests to the nearest exit. Do not allow anyone to re-enter the building.
- **Do not use elevators** during a fire.
- **Do not stop for personal belongings.**
- **If there is smoke, stay low** where the air is clearer.
- **Close doors behind you** as you leave to slow the spread of fire and smoke.

## Fire Extinguisher Locations

Fire extinguishers are mounted in multiple locations throughout each restaurant, including:

- Near each cooking station (Class K)
- In the dining room and bar areas
- Near electrical panels
- At emergency exits

**Know where the extinguishers are at your location.** If you notice an extinguisher is missing, discharged, or has an expired inspection tag, report it to a manager immediately.

## What NOT to Do

- **Never use water on a grease fire.** This is the most dangerous mistake — it causes a fireball and spreads burning grease.
- **Never try to carry a burning pan** outside or to a sink.
- **Never prop open fire doors** or block fire exits with equipment or supplies.
- **Never ignore a small fire** and assume it will go out on its own.
- **Never re-enter the building** after evacuating until emergency responders give the all-clear.

## Training

All employees must complete fire safety training:

- **At hire** — During initial orientation
- **Every six months** — Review of this policy and training video

As part of your training, watch this fire safety overview video:

Your manager will document completion of each training session. If you have not completed your semi-annual review, your manager will follow up with you.

## Reporting

Report any of the following to a manager immediately:

- Blocked fire exits or extinguisher access
- Missing, damaged, or expired fire extinguishers
- Malfunctioning hood suppression systems or fire alarms
- Grease buildup on hoods, vents, or equipment
- Any other fire hazard

You will never be penalized for reporting fire safety concerns.

## Questions

If you have questions about fire safety procedures at your location, ask your manager.
