# Wage Discussions

MKC Restaurants does not prohibit any employee from disclosing his or her own wages and will not take any adverse action against an employee for disclosing his or her own wages or discussing a co-worker's wages, provided the co-worker voluntarily participates in that discussion. Employees are not required to disclose their wages to a co-worker or otherwise, and MKC Restaurants expects all employees to be respectful of their co-workers in this regard.

No form of retaliation shall be taken against an employee who discloses or discusses wages pursuant to this policy. Any employee who believes he or she has been subject to retaliation in violation of this policy is expected to immediately report that information to any manager.
