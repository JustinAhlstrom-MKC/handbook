# Workplace Violence

MKC Restaurants is committed to promoting the safety of all its employees and maintaining a safe and secure work environment. Acts of violence will result in discipline. Acts of violence include:

- Stalking
- Threatening physical or aggressive contact
- Harassing/threatening calls or messages
- Other inappropriate hostile behavior against employees that would cause them to reasonably be in fear of their personal safety

In addition to discipline, MKC Restaurants may contact local law enforcement when such conduct occurs.

MKC Restaurants encourages all employees to promptly and accurately report incidents of violence to their manager and/or ownership. No retaliation will be taken against those who in good faith report workplace violence or threats of violence.

Additionally, MKC Restaurants prohibits weapons at both Margie's Kitchen & Cocktails and Grackle locations, including at company-sponsored events, with the exception of hired professional security personnel. This includes concealed weapons for which an employee may have a permit. Employees with valid carry permits may store firearms in their locked personal vehicles in accordance with Minnesota law.

Employees who obtain a restraining order and list Margie's Kitchen & Cocktails or Grackle locations as protected areas are responsible to immediately report this information to management.
