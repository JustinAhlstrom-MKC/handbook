# Reasonable Accommodations

When an applicant or employee needs a reasonable accommodation, MKC Restaurants will seek to provide one. We will make accommodations for applicants and employees who have physical or mental disabilities, individuals who need an accommodation to practice their faith, and individuals who are pregnant or who have pregnancy-related conditions. We will work with applicants and employees to find a reasonable accommodation that allows the individual to perform the essential functions of the position without an undue burden on the Company.

If you believe you may need an accommodation, please contact any manager.

## Nursing Mothers

MKC Restaurants will provide nursing mothers a private space (other than a bathroom stall) and reasonable break time to any employee who needs to express breast milk for her child. When possible, break time should run concurrently with regular break times already provided. For non-exempt employees, this break time will be unpaid unless the break coincides with a paid break period.

If you have any questions or need accommodation, please contact any manager.
