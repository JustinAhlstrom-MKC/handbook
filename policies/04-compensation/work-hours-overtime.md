# Work Hours & Overtime

MKC Restaurants wants to ensure every employee is paid fairly and consistently with applicable federal and state wage and hour law.

## Work Week

The normal work week for MKC Restaurants is 40 hours. For purposes of overtime calculation, the work week is considered to begin on Monday and end on Sunday.

## Exempt and Non-Exempt Status

Exempt employees are not eligible to receive overtime pay because they are exempt from the provisions of the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA), state, and local laws. Exempt employees are paid a constant salary regardless of the hours worked.

Non-exempt employees are paid for hours worked; therefore, time worked must be accurately recorded in TOAST.

## Overtime

Non-exempt employees are paid the overtime rate of one and one-half times their regular hourly rate for all time worked in excess of 40 hours in any work week. Overtime payment is based on actual hours worked within a work week. Therefore, any hours worked (up to 40 hours) during a work week that includes a holiday or PTO time will be paid as straight time.

Overtime should be approved in advance by your manager. Employees who work overtime without obtaining proper authorization may be subject to disciplinary action. Regardless of whether the overtime was approved or not, employees will be paid for all hours worked.

Your schedule may be adjusted within the same workweek to ensure overtime is not worked or to reduce overtime. However, once overtime is worked, it must be paid — it cannot be replaced with future time off.
