# Cut-Resistant Gloves

To prevent injuries when using sharp tools, all staff must follow these requirements. This policy applies to all team members, including management and student workers.

## When Cut-Resistant Gloves Are Required

**Mandatory** — you must wear a cut-resistant glove (stainless steel if available) when:

- Operating a meat slicer
- Cleaning a meat slicer
- Using a grater or mandoline

**Strongly advised** — you should wear a cut-resistant glove when using any other sharp, including but not limited to:

- Knives
- Peelers
- Box cutters

Pizza cutters are exempt from this policy.

Management may expand glove requirements to additional tasks at their discretion.

## Food Protection Guidelines

Cut-resistant gloves prevent injuries, not contamination. Follow these steps every time:

1. **Inspect the glove** — check for rips or tears before use.
2. **Correct hand** — wear the cut-resistant glove on the hand **not** holding the sharp tool.
3. **Disposable glove over top** — always wear a disposable glove over the cut-resistant glove, without exception.
4. **Change between tasks** — change both gloves whenever you switch products or tasks. Always wash your hands when changing gloves.

## Cleaning & Storage

After each use:

1. Wash the glove with soapy water by putting it on and rubbing your hands together.
2. Rinse with clear, warm water from the fingertips toward the cuff. Do not flush water from the inside toward the fingertips.
3. Air dry completely before storing.

Do not clean cut-resistant gloves in the dishmachine.
