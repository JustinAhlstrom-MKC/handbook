# Discipline

MKC Restaurants expects employees to use good judgment at all times. While we don't relish the idea of discipline, sometimes it is necessary. Discipline may range from verbal coaching to written warnings to termination, depending on the severity of the issue and whether it is a repeated occurrence.

<!-- PLACEHOLDER: Consider adding reference to progressive discipline framework if you want to outline the process here, or note that details are available from management. -->
