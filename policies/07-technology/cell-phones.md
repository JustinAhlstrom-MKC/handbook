# Cell Phones and Personal Devices

We understand that employees may need to be reachable during their shift. At the same time, phone use during service impacts the guest experience and your focus.

## During Your Shift

- Cell phones must not be visible to guests at any time
- Phone use is permitted only during breaks and in employee areas (back of house, break areas)
- Phones should be kept on silent and stored in your pocket or personal bag while on the floor
- Do not use your phone on the floor or in any guest-facing area

## Emergency Calls

If you need to take an urgent call during your shift, step to an employee area away from guests. If you are expecting a time-sensitive call (childcare, medical, etc.), let your manager know at the start of your shift.

## Earbuds and Headphones

Earbuds and headphones may not be worn during your shift. You need to be able to hear guests, coworkers, and safety alerts at all times.

## Expectations

Repeated phone use during service or in guest areas may result in disciplinary action. If you have questions about this policy, talk to your manager.
