## Full-Time Status Determination

**Initial Qualification:** New employees must work an average of 30+ hours per week for their first 90 days to qualify for full-time PTO benefits. PTO accrual begins on day 91.

**Quarterly Review:** FT/PT status is reviewed each calendar quarter based on the prior quarter average.

**Regaining FT Status:** Employee must average 30+ hours/week for a calendar quarter to restart PTO accrual.

## Payout at Termination

- **Sick & Safe Time:** Not paid out at termination
- **Vacation/PTO:** Paid out at termination per Minnesota law
