# Personal Relationships

Relationships at work can be messy and distract from serving our guests. Although this policy does not prevent the development of friendships, romantic relationships between coworkers, or the employment of relatives, it does establish clear boundaries as to how relationships are conducted at work.

While at work, MKC Restaurants expects employees to keep personal exchanges limited so that others are not distracted or offended by such exchanges. Remember, conversations can be interpreted in many different ways. Conversation—even between consenting adults—can be seen as inappropriate or offensive to others in violation of our [Harassment Policy](harassment.md).

Individuals in supervisory/management or other influential roles are subject to more stringent requirements under this policy due to their ability to influence others, affect tenure, promotions, and terms and conditions of employment of their staff.

An employee in a management or supervisory position over another employee who has developed a relationship with that employee that a reasonable person would determine is beyond normal friendship should inform his/her manager of the relationship.
