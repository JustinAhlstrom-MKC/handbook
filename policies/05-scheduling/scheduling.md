# Scheduling

## Scheduling Philosophy

MKC Restaurants builds schedules based on business needs, and assigns shifts based on each team member's ability, availability, and performance. No employee is guaranteed a specific number of hours or shifts per week. Schedules may vary from week to week depending on business volume, staffing needs, and seasonal demands.

Being scheduled for a certain number of hours in one week does not create an expectation or entitlement to the same hours in future weeks.

## Your Role in Scheduling

You are expected to keep your availability up to date in 7shifts. If your availability changes, update it promptly so managers can plan accordingly.

Managers will do their best to consider your preferences, but operational needs come first. Flexibility with your availability — including willingness to work weekends, holidays, and non-prime shifts — is valued and may be considered when building schedules.

## Schedule Changes

Managers may adjust schedules as needed to meet business demands. This may include adding, removing, or modifying shifts. When possible, changes will be communicated in advance, but last-minute adjustments may occasionally be necessary.
