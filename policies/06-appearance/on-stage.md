# On Stage

Guest perceptions matter—everything we do affects our guests. People love to people-watch, and our guests watch each of us. They watch the service, look at our cleanliness and sanitation practices, notice the behaviors and interactions of employees, and see other guests' reactions to what we do.

There isn't much that our guests' eyes will miss. This is why we say you are always "on stage" in front of guests. We are putting on a performance to create a fun and relaxing environment for our guests. The "part" requires that we're professional, upbeat, and friendly, whether we feel like it or not.

We are not here to drop food and beverages in front of people. We are here to build lasting relationships.
