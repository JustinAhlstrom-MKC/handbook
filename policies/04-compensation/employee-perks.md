# Employee Perks

MKC Restaurants offers the following perks to all employees as part of our commitment to taking care of our team.

## Employee Meals

Employees receive one free meal per shift from the employee menu. Employee meals must be consumed on-site and may not be taken home. Meals for family or friends are not included in the employee meal benefit.

## Employee Discount

All employees receive a 50% discount on food purchases. This discount is for the employee's personal use only, requires manager approval, and may not apply to all menu items or specials at management's discretion.
