# Attendance Expectations

Fully staffed shifts are essential to our success. Prompt and regular attendance is a condition of employment for all employees. MKC Restaurants encourages and reinforces good attendance and punctuality.

**Managers are responsible for scheduling appropriate staffing levels. Team members are responsible for working every shift scheduled or finding adequate coverage. Everyone arrives on time and ready to serve our community.**

## Using 7shifts

We use 7shifts to manage scheduling. You are expected to:

- Set your recurring availability and note scheduling preferences in 7shifts
- Request time off at least 3 weeks ahead of time
- Understand that time off requests are not guaranteed
- Find coverage using the shift pool when you cannot work a scheduled shift
- Keep call-outs to a minimum

## Attendance Standards

Attendance issues are evaluated on a case-by-case basis, considering frequency, patterns, business impact, and overall performance. Excessive absences, repeated tardiness, or patterns of calling out (such as consistently missing weekend shifts) may result in disciplinary action.

This policy does not apply to absences protected by law, including Sick and Safe Time, FMLA leave, Minnesota Paid Leave, or other legally protected leave.

## Call-Out Procedures

When unable to report to work due to an illness or emergency, you must contact your manager directly as far in advance as possible before your scheduled shift. In the event of an emergency, notify your manager as soon as practical. Contacting a co-worker is not a substitute for notifying your manager. If your absence extends beyond one day, check in with your manager each day unless otherwise instructed.
