# Retaliation

MKC Restaurants will not retaliate against any applicant or employee for reporting concerns, making complaints in good faith, assisting with investigations, filing workers' compensation claims, requesting accommodations, discussing wages, or exercising any other rights protected by law. Retaliation could take on many forms, including intimidation, threats, isolation, demotion, or termination. If you believe this is happening to any applicant or employee, please contact any manager.
