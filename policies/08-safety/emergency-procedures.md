# Emergency Procedures

The safety of our employees and guests is our top priority. Emergency procedures — including fire evacuation, severe weather shelter, medical emergencies, and security incidents — are posted at each location. Familiarize yourself with these procedures and the location of emergency exits, fire extinguishers, and first aid kits.

If you have questions about emergency procedures at your location, ask your manager.
