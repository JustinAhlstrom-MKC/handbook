# Tip Policy

Tips are an important part of compensation for many of our team members. This policy outlines how tips are handled at MKC Restaurants.

## Tips Belong to Employees

All tips received by employees are the property of those employees. MKC Restaurants does not take any portion of employee tips for any purpose.

## Credit Card Tips

Credit card tips are paid out in cash at the end of your shift. MKC Restaurants does not deduct credit card processing fees from your tips. Credit card tips are automatically reported through the POS system and are subject to applicable taxes.

## Cash Tips

Cash tips received during your shift are yours to keep. You are responsible for reporting all cash tips accurately for tax purposes.

## Tip Sharing

MKC Restaurants does not operate a mandatory tip pool. As is common practice in the restaurant industry, tipped employees often tip out support staff — such as service support, food runners, barbacks, and service bartenders — in recognition of the teamwork that goes into every shift. Any such tip sharing is voluntary and at the individual employee's discretion.

Managers and supervisors never participate in tip sharing in any capacity, in accordance with federal and Minnesota law.

## Tip Reporting

Credit card tips are automatically reported through the POS system. You are responsible for accurately reporting any cash tips as well. You will receive training on how to report tips through the POS system.

## Questions

If you have questions about tips, tip sharing, or how tips are distributed, please speak with your manager.
