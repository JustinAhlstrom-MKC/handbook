# Family and Medical Leave (FMLA)

MKC Restaurants complies with the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA), which provides eligible employees with up to 12 weeks of unpaid, job-protected leave per year for qualifying family and medical reasons.

## Eligibility

You are eligible for FMLA leave if you have:

- Worked for MKC Restaurants for at least **12 months** (does not need to be consecutive), AND
- Worked at least **1,250 hours** during the 12 months immediately before your leave begins

## Qualifying Reasons

- Your own serious health condition that makes you unable to perform your job
- Caring for a spouse, child, or parent with a serious health condition
- Birth or placement of a child (bonding leave must be taken within 12 months)
- A qualifying exigency related to a family member's military service

## How Much Leave

You are entitled to up to **12 weeks** of FMLA leave in a 12-month period, measured on a **rolling basis** counting backward from the date you use any FMLA leave. When medically necessary, leave may be taken intermittently or on a reduced schedule.

## Pay During Leave

You are required to use your accrued PTO and Sick & Safe Time concurrently with FMLA leave. Once paid leave is exhausted, the remainder of your FMLA leave will be unpaid. You may also be eligible for wage replacement through [Minnesota Paid Leave](mn-paid-leave.md).

## Job Protection

When you return from FMLA leave, you are entitled to be restored to the same or an equivalent position with the same pay, benefits, and working conditions. Your health and dental coverage continues during FMLA leave on the same terms as if you were actively working.

## How to Request Leave

- **Foreseeable leave:** Provide at least **30 days' notice** (e.g., expected birth, planned surgery)
- **Unforeseeable leave:** Notify your manager as soon as possible

We may request medical certification to support your leave. If your leave also qualifies under Minnesota's Paid Leave program, both will run concurrently — see the [Minnesota Paid Leave](mn-paid-leave.md) policy for details.

MKC Restaurants will not retaliate against any employee for requesting or taking FMLA leave.
