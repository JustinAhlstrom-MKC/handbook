# Welcome to MKC Restaurants

<!-- PLACEHOLDER: Personal welcome message from Becky and/or Justin. Suggested content below - please personalize. -->

Dear Team Member,

Welcome to the MKC Restaurants family! Whether you're joining us at Margie's Kitchen & Cocktails or Grackle, we're thrilled to have you on our team.

When we opened Margie's in 2020, we set out to create more than just a restaurant—we wanted to build a place where our community could gather, celebrate, and feel at home. That vision continues with Grackle, and it's only possible because of team members like you.

We believe that taking care of our team is just as important as taking care of our guests. When you succeed, we all succeed. We're committed to providing you with the training, support, and opportunities you need to grow in your role.

This handbook outlines our policies and expectations, but it's really about one thing: working together to create great experiences for our guests and each other. If you ever have questions or concerns, our door is always open.

Thank you for choosing to be part of our team. We can't wait to see what we'll accomplish together.

Welcome aboard,

**Becky & Justin Ahlstrom**
Owners, MKC Restaurants
