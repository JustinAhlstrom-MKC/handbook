# Personal Relationships

Relationships at work can be messy and distract from serving our guests. Although this policy does not prevent the development of friendships, romantic relationships between coworkers, or the employment of relatives, it does establish clear boundaries as to how relationships are conducted at work.

While at work, MKC Restaurants expects employees to keep personal exchanges limited so that others are not distracted or offended by such exchanges. Remember, conversations can be interpreted in many different ways. Conversation—even between consenting adults—can be seen as inappropriate or offensive to others in violation of our [Harassment Policy](harassment.md).

Individuals in supervisory/management or other influential roles are subject to more stringent requirements under this policy due to their ability to influence others, affect tenure, promotions, and terms and conditions of employment of their staff.

## Disclosure

An employee in a management or supervisory position who develops a romantic relationship with someone they supervise or influence must disclose the relationship to ownership promptly. Failure to disclose may result in reassignment of reporting relationships or other corrective action.

Disclosure allows us to address potential conflicts of interest — such as adjusting scheduling, reporting structures, or performance review responsibilities — to protect everyone involved.
