## Workflow

**Status values:**
- `draft` - Initial content, not yet reviewed
- `in-review` - Currently being reviewed/edited
- `approved` - Reviewed and approved by Justin
- `active` - Published and in effect

**Review process:**
1. Pick a policy to review
2. Update status to `in-review`
3. Review content, make edits as needed
4. When satisfied, update status to `approved`
5. Commit changes with descriptive message
6. Once all policies approved, batch update to `active` for go-live
