- [x] **Strengthen Introductory Period At-Will Language** - `policies/02-employment/introductory-period.md`

### ACA Compliance (if applicable)

- [ ] **Review ACA Measurement Periods** - `policies/02-employment/employee-classifications.md`
  - 50+ employees confirmed — ACA likely applies (Applicable Large Employer)
  - Current quarterly measurement periods may not align with ACA safe harbor
  - **Action: Consult benefits attorney or broker before distribution**

---

## LOW PRIORITY - Best Practices

- [ ] **Add Required Postings Reference**
  - Create section referencing where employment posters are displayed

- [ ] **Standardize Reporting Channels**
  - Most policies now say "any manager" with backup to ownership (Justin/Becky)
  - Harassment policy explicitly lists Justin and Becky email addresses
  - Consider whether other policies should also list ownership emails

- [ ] **Consider Adding:**
  - Jury duty / voting leave policy
  - Military leave (USERRA) policy — relevant given FMLA military provisions
  - Lactation accommodation standalone policy (currently covered briefly in accommodations.md)

  - Verified against official MN Paid Leave Notice provided to employees
