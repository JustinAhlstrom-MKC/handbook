# Equal Employment Opportunity

MKC Restaurants enjoys operating in our diverse community. We want to reflect our community to enable every guest to feel welcome. For this reason, MKC Restaurants is committed to being an equal opportunity employer.

MKC Restaurants will not use an individual's age, race, color, gender, gender identity, religion, national origin, disability (mental or physical) status, marital or familial status, sexual orientation, pregnancy, protected military or veteran status, genetic information, status with regard to public assistance, or any other characteristic protected by federal, state, or local law, to make an employment decision. These characteristics will not be used in recruitment, hiring, training, promotion, compensation, demotion, layoffs, recall, termination, or any other employment decision.

Managers have a particular responsibility to prevent and stop discrimination. Managers are required to be aware of this policy, refrain from discrimination, and inform Justin or Becky as soon as they suspect or become aware of an allegation of discrimination.
