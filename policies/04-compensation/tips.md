# Tip Policy

Tips are an important part of compensation for many of our team members. This policy outlines how tips are handled at MKC Restaurants.

<!-- PLACEHOLDER: Review and customize tip pool percentages and procedures for each location. The structure below is a starting point. -->

## Tips Belong to Employees

All tips received by employees are the property of those employees. MKC Restaurants does not take any portion of employee tips for any purpose.

## Credit Card Tips

Tips left on credit card transactions are paid out to employees. Credit card tips are included in your regular paycheck and are subject to applicable taxes.

## Cash Tips

Cash tips received during your shift are yours to keep. You are responsible for reporting all cash tips for tax purposes. Tips over $20 in a calendar month must be reported.

## Tip Pooling

<!-- PLACEHOLDER: Define tip pool structure if applicable. Example below - customize based on your actual practice. -->

MKC Restaurants utilizes a tip pooling arrangement for certain positions. Tip pool contributions and distributions are as follows:

**Participating Positions:**
- Servers
- Bartenders
- Bussers
- Food Runners
- Barbacks

**Tip Out Structure:**
- [Customize: e.g., "Servers tip out 3% of sales to support staff"]
- [Customize: specific percentages and recipients]

Management and ownership do not participate in tip pools.

## Tip Reporting

All tips, including cash tips, must be reported accurately for tax purposes. You will receive training on how to report tips through our POS system.

## Questions

If you have questions about tips, tip pooling, or how tips are calculated, please speak with your manager.
