# About MKC Restaurants

MKC Restaurants is the parent company operating both Margie's Kitchen & Cocktails and Grackle restaurant locations in Maple Grove, Minnesota. Both restaurants are family-owned and operated by Becky and Justin Ahlstrom, with deep roots in community service and hospitality excellence.

## Margie's Kitchen & Cocktails

**Address:** 16691 Zurich St NE, Andover, MN 55304
**Phone:** (763) 205-4762
**Website:** www.margies-kitchen.com

Opened in 2020, Margie's Kitchen & Cocktails is named after Justin's grandmother, Marge, who owned and operated Lyle's Cafe in Winthrop, Minnesota for nearly 40 years. Beyond the home cooking and pies she made Lyle's Cafe famous for, Marge made the cafe the center of her community. We honor her legacy by making Margie's a fixture in the Maple Grove community—a place where everyone is welcome.

## Grackle

**Address:** 11852 Elm Creek Blvd N, Maple Grove, MN 55369
**Phone:** (763) 898-3140
**Website:** www.gracklegrove.com

Grackle opened in October 2024. In naming the restaurant, we felt it was important to maintain a connection to Margie and her community. Grackle Days has been the annual Winthrop town festival since 1985, celebrating the small-town spirit that Grandma Marge embodied.
