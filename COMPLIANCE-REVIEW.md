1. **Employee Count:** How many total employees across both locations? (Determines FMLA applicability)

2. **Drug Testing:** Do you conduct or plan to conduct drug/alcohol testing?

3. **Tip Sharing:** What are the actual tip sharing practices? Who participates?

4. **Meal Breaks:** Are meal breaks paid or unpaid? What duration?

5. **Pay Schedule:** Confirm exact pay periods and pay dates

6. **Cell Phone Storage:** Where should employees store phones during shifts?
