# Reasonable Accommodations

When an applicant or employee needs a reasonable accommodation, MKC Restaurants will seek to provide one. We will make accommodations for applicants and employees who have physical or mental disabilities, individuals who need an accommodation to practice their faith, and individuals who are pregnant or who have pregnancy-related conditions. We will work with applicants and employees to find a reasonable accommodation that allows the individual to perform the essential functions of the position without an undue burden on the Company.

## How to Request an Accommodation

If you believe you may need an accommodation, contact any manager. We will then work with you through an interactive process:

1. **You describe your needs** — Let us know what limitations you are experiencing and what kind of accommodation might help
2. **We discuss options together** — We will explore possible accommodations that allow you to perform the essential functions of your job
3. **We may request documentation** — In some cases, we may ask for documentation from your health care provider or other professional to help us understand your needs and identify effective accommodations
4. **We implement an accommodation** — We will respond to accommodation requests promptly and implement an appropriate accommodation

If an accommodation is not working effectively, let your manager know so we can revisit and adjust as needed.

## Nursing Mothers

MKC Restaurants will provide nursing mothers a private space (other than a bathroom stall) and reasonable break time to any employee who needs to express breast milk for her child. When possible, break time should run concurrently with regular break times already provided. For non-exempt employees, this break time will be unpaid unless the break coincides with a paid break period.

If you have any questions or need accommodation, please contact any manager.
