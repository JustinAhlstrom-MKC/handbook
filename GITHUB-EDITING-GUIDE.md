# Editing Handbook Policies on GitHub

## Quick Steps

1. **Go to the repository:** https://github.com/JustinAhlstrom-MKC/handbook

2. **Navigate to the policy:** Click through folders to find the file (e.g., `policies` → `01-welcome` → `about-mkc.md`)

3. **Click the pencil icon** (top right of the file content) to edit

4. **Make your changes** in the editor

5. **Save your changes:**
   - Scroll down to "Commit changes"
   - Write a brief description of what you changed (e.g., "Updated phone number")
   - Click the green "Commit changes" button

## Tips

- **Don't edit the stuff at the top** between the `---` lines (that's metadata)
- **Preview your changes** using the "Preview" tab before committing
- **Use simple formatting:**
  - `**bold text**` → **bold text**
  - `- item` → bullet point
  - `## Heading` → section heading
