# Time Off Policy

## Purpose

MKC Restaurants recognizes that time away from work is essential to employee well-being, health, and work-life balance. We provide paid time off to support our employees when they need to be away from work.

This policy covers two types of paid time off:

- **Sick and Safe Time (SST):** Required by Minnesota law, this time is designated for specific qualifying reasons such as illness, medical appointments, and safety-related absences. All employees are eligible.

- **Vacation/PTO:** Additional paid time off for personal use—whether for rest, travel, family events, or any reason you choose. Available to full-time hourly employees and exempt management.

Your eligibility for time off benefits depends on your employee classification. See the [Employee Classifications](../02-employment/employee-classifications.md) policy for details on how full-time and part-time status is determined.

## Time Off by Classification

| Classification | Sick & Safe Time | Vacation/PTO |
|----------------|------------------|--------------|
| Part-Time Hourly | Accrued up to 48 hrs/year | None |
| Full-Time Hourly | Accrued up to 48 hrs/year | Accrued up to 40 hrs/year |
| Exempt Management | Accrued up to 48 hrs/year | Accrued up to 80 hrs/year |

## Sick and Safe Time

All employees earn Sick and Safe Time in compliance with Minnesota's Earned Sick and Safe Time (ESST) law.

### Accrual

- **Rate:** 1 hour earned per 30 hours worked
- **Begins:** First day of employment
- **Annual Cap:** 48 hours earned per year
- **Balance Cap:** Up to 80 hours total balance (carryover allowed)
- **Usage Begins:** After 90 days of employment

### Eligible Uses

You may use earned Sick and Safe Time for:

- Your mental or physical illness, treatment, or preventive care
- A family member's mental or physical illness, treatment, or preventive care
- Absence due to domestic abuse, sexual assault, or stalking of you or a family member
- Closure of your workplace due to weather or public emergency
- Closure of a family member's school or care facility due to weather or public emergency
- When determined by a health authority or health care professional that you or a family member is at risk of infecting others with a communicable disease
- To make funeral arrangements, attend a funeral service or memorial, or address financial or legal matters that arise after the death of a family member

### Definition of Family Member

Under Minnesota law, "family member" includes:

- Your child (including foster child, adult child, legal ward)
- Your spouse or registered domestic partner
- Your sibling, stepsibling, or foster sibling
- Your parent, stepparent, or a person who stood in loco parentis when you were a minor
- Your grandchild, foster grandchild, or step-grandchild
- Your grandparent or step-grandparent
- A child, parent, or sibling of your spouse/domestic partner
- Any individual related by blood or whose close association with you is the equivalent of a family relationship
- Up to one individual annually designated by you

### Documentation

For absences exceeding two consecutive scheduled workdays, MKC Restaurants may request reasonable documentation. However, you will not be required to disclose specific medical conditions or details about domestic violence situations. Alternative documentation options will be available if obtaining standard verification would create unreasonable burden or expense.

## Vacation/PTO

Vacation/PTO is additional paid time off for personal use. Unlike Sick and Safe Time, you may use PTO for any reason.
