# Meal & Rest Breaks

MKC Restaurants provides breaks in accordance with Minnesota law and our commitment to employee wellbeing.

## Rest Breaks

Employees working 4 or more consecutive hours are entitled to reasonable time to use the restroom. You do not need to clock out for restroom breaks.

## Meal Breaks

Employees working 8 or more consecutive hours are entitled to a meal break of sufficient time to eat. The timing of meal breaks will be determined by your manager based on business needs.

<!-- PLACEHOLDER: Clarify if meal breaks are paid or unpaid, and duration -->

**Meal Break Guidelines:**
- Meal breaks are typically [30 minutes / unpaid] for shifts of 8+ hours
- You must clock out for unpaid meal breaks
- Meal breaks should be taken away from your work station when possible
- If you are required to remain on duty during your meal break, you will be paid for that time

## Employee Meals

<!-- PLACEHOLDER: Define employee meal policy - discounts, free meals during shifts, etc. -->

MKC Restaurants provides [employee meal benefits - customize]:

- [Example: 50% discount on food during shifts]
- [Example: One free meal per shift worked]
- [Example: Specific menu items available for employee meals]

Employee meals must be consumed on-site and may not be taken home. Meals for family or friends are not included in employee meal benefits.

## Scheduling Breaks

Managers will work to ensure you receive your entitled breaks. Due to the nature of restaurant work, break times may vary based on business flow. If you are unable to take a break during your shift, inform your manager.

## Nursing Mothers

Nursing mothers are entitled to reasonable break time and a private space to express breast milk. See our Reasonable Accommodations policy for details.
