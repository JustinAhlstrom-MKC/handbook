# Employee Classifications

MKC Restaurants classifies employees based on their work hours and job duties. Your classification determines eligibility for benefits including PTO, health insurance, and other programs.

## Classification Definitions

### Part-Time Hourly

Employees who average **less than 30 hours per week**.

### Full-Time Hourly

Employees who average **30 or more hours per week**.

### Exempt (Salaried Management)

Managers and other employees classified as exempt from overtime requirements under the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA). Exempt employees are paid a fixed salary regardless of hours worked.

## How Classification is Determined

### New Employees

When you are hired, you will be assigned an initial classification based on your expected schedule.

**Initial Full-Time Qualification:**
New employees must average 30+ hours per week during their first **30 days of employment** to qualify as full-time.

After your initial 30-day evaluation, your classification will be reviewed according to the quarterly schedule below.

### Ongoing Classification Reviews

Employee classifications are reviewed **quarterly** based on hours worked during the prior quarter.

**Review Schedule:**

| Review Date | Based on Hours From |
|-------------|---------------------|
| April 1 | Q1: January 1 – March 31 |
| July 1 | Q2: April 1 – June 30 |
| October 1 | Q3: July 1 – September 30 |
| January 1 | Q4: October 1 – December 31 |

### Gaining Full-Time Status

If you are part-time and your average hours increase to 30+ per week for a full quarter, you will be reclassified as full-time on the next review date.

### Losing Full-Time Status

If you are full-time and your average hours fall below 30 per week for a full quarter, you will be reclassified as part-time on the next review date. See the [Time Off Policy](../04-compensation/pto-policy.md) and [Benefits](../04-compensation/benefits.md) for how reclassification affects those programs.

### Regaining Full-Time Status

If you lose full-time status, you can regain it by averaging 30+ hours per week for a full quarter.

## Hours Calculation

Average weekly hours are calculated by dividing total hours worked during the measurement period by the number of **adjusted weeks** in that period.

### Initial 30-Day Period

Total hours worked ÷ approximately 4 weeks.

### Quarterly Review

Total hours worked in the quarter ÷ adjusted weeks in the quarter.

**Adjusted weeks** account for days when both restaurant locations are closed. To calculate:

1. Start with the total **calendar days** in the quarter (typically 90–92)
2. Subtract any **company closure days** (days when both locations are closed)
3. Divide the result by **7**

> **Example:** Q1 has 90 calendar days. Both locations are closed January 1–5 (5 days).
> Adjusted weeks = (90 − 5) ÷ 7 = **12.14 weeks**.
> An employee who works 380 hours that quarter averages 380 ÷ 12.14 = **31.3 hours per week**.

This adjustment ensures employees are not penalized for days they were unable to work due to company closures.
