# Family and Medical Leave (FMLA)

MKC Restaurants complies with the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA), which provides eligible employees with up to 12 weeks of unpaid, job-protected leave per year for qualifying family and medical reasons.

## Eligibility

You are eligible for FMLA leave if you have:

- Worked for MKC Restaurants for at least **12 months** (does not need to be consecutive), AND
- Worked at least **1,250 hours** during the 12 months immediately before your leave begins

If you are unsure whether you qualify, ask your manager.

## Qualifying Reasons for Leave

Eligible employees may take FMLA leave for the following reasons:

- **Your own serious health condition** that makes you unable to perform your job
- **Caring for a family member** (spouse, child, or parent) with a serious health condition
- **Birth or placement of a child** — bonding with a newborn, newly adopted child, or newly placed foster child (must be taken within 12 months of birth or placement)
- **Qualifying exigency** arising from a spouse, child, or parent's active duty or call to active duty in the Armed Forces

## Military Caregiver Leave

Eligible employees may take up to **26 weeks** of leave in a single 12-month period to care for a covered servicemember (spouse, child, parent, or next of kin) with a serious injury or illness incurred in the line of duty.

## How Much Leave

You are entitled to up to **12 weeks** of FMLA leave in a 12-month period. The 12-month period is measured on a **rolling basis**, counting backward from the date you use any FMLA leave.

## Intermittent and Reduced Schedule Leave

When medically necessary, FMLA leave may be taken in separate blocks of time or by reducing your normal work schedule. If you need intermittent or reduced schedule leave, work with your manager to minimize disruption to operations.

Intermittent leave for bonding with a newborn or newly placed child requires manager approval.

## Use of Paid Leave

You are required to use your accrued paid time off (PTO and Sick & Safe Time) concurrently with FMLA leave. This means your FMLA leave will be paid to the extent you have accrued time available. Once paid leave is exhausted, the remainder of your FMLA leave will be unpaid.

You may also be eligible for wage replacement through [Minnesota Paid Leave](mn-paid-leave.md) during FMLA-qualifying leave.

## Benefits During Leave

Your health and dental insurance coverage will continue during FMLA leave on the same terms as if you were actively working. You are responsible for continuing to pay your share of any benefit premiums during your leave.

If you do not return from FMLA leave, MKC Restaurants may recover the cost of benefit premiums paid on your behalf during the leave, unless you do not return due to a serious health condition or other circumstances beyond your control.

## Notice Requirements

- **Foreseeable leave:** Provide at least **30 days' written notice** before your leave begins (e.g., expected birth, planned medical treatment)
- **Unforeseeable leave:** Notify your manager as soon as practicable, generally the same day you learn of the need for leave

When requesting leave, provide enough information for us to determine whether FMLA applies. You do not need to mention FMLA by name, but you must explain the reason for the leave.

## Medical Certification

MKC Restaurants may require a medical certification from your health care provider to support your leave request. You will be given at least 15 calendar days to provide the certification.

We may also request recertification during your leave in certain circumstances, and may require a fitness-for-duty certification before you return to work.

## Job Protection

When you return from FMLA leave, you are entitled to be restored to the same position you held before your leave, or to an equivalent position with the same pay, benefits, and working conditions.

## Coordination with Minnesota Paid Leave

When your leave qualifies under both FMLA and Minnesota's Paid Leave program, the two will run concurrently. Minnesota Paid Leave may provide partial wage replacement during your leave. See the [Minnesota Paid Leave](mn-paid-leave.md) policy for details on eligibility and benefits.

## No Retaliation

MKC Restaurants will not retaliate against any employee for requesting or taking FMLA leave. If you believe you have been retaliated against, report it to any manager or directly to ownership.

## Questions

If you have questions about FMLA leave or need to request leave, talk to your manager.
