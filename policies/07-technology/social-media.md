# Social Media

Remember that our standards of behavior extend beyond the walls of the restaurant—this includes online behavior. Employees should not post content that could be considered harassment, bullying, or that misrepresents MKC Restaurants. When in doubt, do not post.

<!-- PLACEHOLDER: Consider adding more specific social media guidelines - representing the company online, photography policies, etc. -->
