# Separation of Employment

Employment at MKC Restaurants may end for various reasons, including voluntary resignation, termination, or job elimination. This policy outlines the separation process.

## Voluntary Resignation

If you decide to leave MKC Restaurants, we ask that you provide advance notice:

- **Hourly employees:** At least 2 weeks notice
- **Management:** At least 4 weeks notice

Notice should be provided in writing to your manager. Providing adequate notice helps us plan coverage and allows for a smooth transition. Employees who provide appropriate notice and leave in good standing may be considered for rehire.

## Final Pay

**Voluntary resignation:** Your final paycheck will be issued on the next regular payday.

**Involuntary termination:** Your final paycheck will be available within 24 hours upon your request, or at the next regular payday, in accordance with Minnesota law.

Final pay will include:
- All hours worked through your last day
- Accrued, unused PTO (vacation time) per Minnesota law
- Any other earned wages

Sick & Safe Time is not paid out upon separation.

## Return of Company Property

On or before your last day, you must return all company property, including:

- Keys and access cards
- Uniforms and aprons
- Name tags
- Any other company equipment or materials

Failure to return company property may result in deductions from your final pay to the extent permitted by law, or other collection efforts.

## Exit Process

Depending on circumstances, your manager may:
- Conduct an exit interview
- Review return of property
- Confirm your forwarding address for tax documents (W-2)
- Answer questions about benefits continuation (if applicable)

## Rehire Eligibility

Employees who leave in good standing with proper notice may be eligible for rehire. Employees who are terminated for cause, abandon their job, or leave without notice may not be eligible for rehire.

## References

MKC Restaurants will confirm dates of employment and positions held for reference requests. Additional information will only be provided with written authorization from the former employee.
