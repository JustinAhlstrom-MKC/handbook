This policy outlines eligibility and enrollment information. Plan details and costs are available in ADP during open enrollment.

## Health & Dental Eligibility

## Enrollment

Eligible employees may enroll in benefits:

Enrollment is completed through your manager. Contact your manager or HR for assistance.

## If You Lose Full-Time Status

If your classification changes from full-time to part-time:

- **Probationary Quarter:** Your health and dental coverage continues for one probationary quarter
- **Second Consecutive Quarter:** If your hours remain below 30/week for two consecutive quarters, health and dental benefits will end at the close of the second quarter
- **Return to Full-Time:** If your hours return to 30+/week during the probationary quarter, you remain benefits-eligible with no interruption

## Regaining Eligibility

If you lose benefits due to part-time status and later regain full-time status, you may re-enroll:

- During the next **open enrollment period**, or
- Within **30 days of regaining full-time status** (qualifying event)

## Cost

Employees who enroll in benefits share the cost of coverage through payroll deductions. Current contribution amounts are available from HR.
