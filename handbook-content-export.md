## about-mkc.md

### About MKC Restaurants

MKC Restaurants is the parent company operating both Margie's Kitchen & Cocktails and Grackle restaurant locations in Maple Grove, Minnesota. Both restaurants are family-owned and operated by Becky and Justin Ahlstrom, with deep roots in community service and hospitality excellence.

### Margie's Kitchen & Cocktails

**Address:** 16691 Zurich St NE, Andover, MN 55304
**Phone:** (763) 205-4762
**Website:** www.margies-kitchen.com

Opened in 2020, Margie's Kitchen & Cocktails is named after Justin's grandmother, Marge, who owned and operated Lyle's Cafe in Winthrop, Minnesota for nearly 40 years. Beyond the home cooking and pies she made Lyle's Cafe famous for, Marge made the cafe the center of her community. We honor her legacy by making Margie's a fixture in the Maple Grove community—a place where everyone is welcome.

### Grackle

**Address:** 11852 Elm Creek Blvd N, Maple Grove, MN 55369
**Phone:** (763) 898-3140
**Website:** www.gracklegrove.com

Grackle opened in October 2024. In naming the restaurant, we felt it was important to maintain a connection to Margie and her community. Grackle Days has been the annual Winthrop town festival since 1985, celebrating the small-town spirit that Grandma Marge embodied.

# SECTION 2: EMPLOYMENT BASICS

## at-will.md

### At-Will Employment

Employment at MKC Restaurants is "at will." This means that either you or the Company may terminate the employment relationship at any time, with or without cause, and with or without notice. No contract other than "at will" has been expressed or implied, and no circumstances arising out of your employment will alter your "at will" employment relationship unless expressed in writing and signed by both you and Justin Ahlstrom.

---

## eeo.md

### Equal Employment Opportunity

MKC Restaurants enjoys operating in our diverse community. We want to reflect our community to enable every guest to feel welcome. For this reason, MKC Restaurants is committed to being an equal opportunity employer.

MKC Restaurants will not use an individual's age, race, color, gender, gender identity, religion, national origin, disability (mental or physical) status, marital or familial status, sexual orientation, pregnancy, protected military or veteran status, genetic information, or any other characteristic protected by law, to make an employment decision. These characteristics will not be used in recruitment, hiring, training, promotion, compensation, demotion, layoffs, recall, termination, or any other employment decision.

Managers have a particular responsibility to prevent and stop discrimination. Managers are required to be aware of this policy, refrain from discrimination, and inform Justin as soon as they suspect or become aware of an allegation of discrimination.

---

## accommodations.md

### Reasonable Accommodations

When an applicant or employee needs a reasonable accommodation, MKC Restaurants will seek to provide one. We will make accommodations for applicants and employees who have physical or mental disabilities, individuals who need an accommodation to practice their faith, and individuals who are pregnant or who have pregnancy-related conditions. We will work with applicants and employees to find a reasonable accommodation that allows the individual to perform the essential functions of the position without an undue burden on the Company.

If you believe you may need an accommodation, please contact any manager.

### Nursing Mothers

MKC Restaurants will provide nursing mothers a private space (other than a bathroom stall) and reasonable break time to any employee who needs to express breast milk for her child. When possible, break time should run concurrently with regular break times already provided. For non-exempt employees, this break time will be unpaid unless the break coincides with a paid break period.

If you have any questions or need accommodation, please contact any manager.

---

# SECTION 3: WORKPLACE CONDUCT

## safe-inclusive-environment.md

### Safe and Inclusive Work Environment

MKC Restaurants is 100% committed to providing a safe, respectful, and inclusive work environment for all team members. We have no tolerance for behavior that makes coworkers or guests feel uncomfortable.

**Our standards of behavior extend beyond the walls of the restaurant—this includes online behavior.** Report any concerns to management immediately.

---

## harassment.md

### Harassment Policy

MKC Restaurants fosters a respectful workplace. We want every employee to treat each other and every guest with respect, even where disagreements may exist. You are free to complain, express frustrations, and disagree, but you must do so respectfully. It is the responsibility of every manager and employee to be respectful.

Harassment is not respectful. Harassment is also against the law. Harassment that is based on an individual's age, race, color, gender, gender identity, religion, national origin, disability (mental or physical) status, marital or familial status, sexual orientation, pregnancy, protected military or veteran status, genetic information, or any other characteristic protected by law will not be tolerated.

Sexual harassment is also prohibited under this policy and under federal and many state and local laws. Sexual harassment includes sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, and other verbal or physical conduct involving sex. Even though a comment or conduct does not express a sexual desire, comments or conduct may still be sexual harassment.

Harassment is defined as conduct or comments that have the purpose or effect of interfering with an individual's employment. The comments or conduct that could be harassment include:

- Slurs, epithets, or insults
- Sexual comments and conversations
- Demeaning or belittling comments or jokes
- Displays of offensive or demeaning images, cartoons, or stories
- Threatening adverse employment actions if sexual favors are not granted or promising preferential treatment in return for sexual favors

MKC Restaurants considers this conduct to be misconduct and will discipline employees who engage in this conduct. The discipline may include termination.

#### Manager Responsibilities

Managers are responsible to prevent and stop harassment. Managers are required to be aware of this policy, refrain from harassment, and inform Justin as soon as they suspect or become aware of an allegation of harassment. If a manager is aware of harassment and does not report the conduct, the manager will be disciplined.

#### Please Tell Us

MKC Restaurants takes allegations of harassment seriously. We encourage applicants and employees to tell any manager if they believe they have been harassed or have witnessed harassment. You may contact them in any manner you feel most comfortable, including via phone, email, in-person discussion, or letter.

MKC Restaurants will keep allegations of harassment as confidential as possible. Only those individuals who need to know will know. That said, it may not be possible to keep all allegations confidential as an investigation and action may be necessary.

#### Investigation

When we learn of potential harassment, MKC Restaurants will take appropriate action to stop the conduct. This includes conducting an investigation to learn more about the comments or conduct from those employees or other individuals involved. An investigation may include interviewing individuals, examining various technologies (including email, cell phone, and text records), and reviewing policies. Following the investigation, you will be told of the outcome.

---

## workplace-violence.md

### Workplace Violence

MKC Restaurants is committed to promoting the safety of all its employees and maintaining a safe and secure work environment. Acts of violence will result in discipline. Acts of violence include:

- Stalking
- Threatening physical or aggressive contact
- Harassing/threatening calls or messages
- Other inappropriate hostile behavior against employees that would cause them to reasonably be in fear of their personal safety

In addition to discipline, MKC Restaurants may contact local law enforcement when such conduct occurs.

MKC Restaurants encourages all employees to promptly and accurately report incidents of violence to their manager and/or ownership. No retaliation will be taken against those who in good faith report workplace violence or threats of violence.

Additionally, MKC Restaurants prohibits weapons at both Margie's Kitchen & Cocktails and Grackle locations, including at company-sponsored events, with the exception of hired professional security personnel. This includes concealed weapons for which an employee may have a permit.

Employees who obtain a restraining order and list Margie's Kitchen & Cocktails or Grackle locations as protected areas are responsible to immediately report this information to management.

---

## substance-free.md

### Substance-Free Workplace

Employees are not allowed to be under the influence of drugs or alcohol while working. Employees exhibiting signs of being under the influence of drugs or alcohol while working will be subject to immediate discipline, up to and including termination.

There is no tolerance for drinking or using other drugs while working. Working while impaired is unsafe and does not enable us to provide great guest experiences.

---

## personal-relationships.md

### Personal Relationships

Relationships at work can be messy and distract from serving our guests. Although this policy does not prevent the development of friendships, romantic relationships between coworkers, or the employment of relatives, it does establish clear boundaries as to how relationships are conducted at work.

While at work, MKC Restaurants expects employees to keep personal exchanges limited so that others are not distracted or offended by such exchanges. Remember, conversations can be interpreted in many different ways. Conversation—even between consenting adults—can be seen as inappropriate or offensive to others in violation of our Harassment Policy.

Individuals in supervisory/management or other influential roles are subject to more stringent requirements under this policy due to their ability to influence others, affect tenure, promotions, and terms and conditions of employment of their staff.

An employee in a management or supervisory position over another employee who has developed a relationship with that employee that a reasonable person would determine is beyond normal friendship should inform his/her manager of the relationship.

---

## retaliation.md

### Retaliation

MKC Restaurants will not retaliate against any applicant or employee for reporting, objecting to, or assisting with an investigation related to these policies or federal or state law. Retaliation could take on many forms, including intimidation, threats, isolation, demotion, or termination. If you believe this is happening to any applicant or employee, please contact any manager.

---

# SECTION 4: COMPENSATION & TIME OFF

## work-hours-overtime.md

### Work Hours & Overtime

MKC Restaurants wants to ensure every employee is paid fairly and consistently with applicable federal and state wage and hour law.

#### Work Week

The normal work week for MKC Restaurants is 40 hours. For purposes of overtime calculation, the work week is considered to begin on Sunday and end on Saturday.

#### Exempt and Non-Exempt Status

Exempt employees are not eligible to receive overtime pay because they are exempt from the provisions of the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA), state, and local laws. Exempt employees are paid a constant salary regardless of the hours worked.

Non-exempt employees are paid for hours worked; therefore, time worked must be accurately recorded in ADP.

#### Overtime

Non-exempt employees are paid the overtime rate of one and one-half times their regular hourly rate for all time worked in excess of 40 hours in any work week. Overtime payment is based on actual hours worked within a work week. Therefore, any hours worked (up to 40 hours) during a work week that includes a holiday or PTO time will be paid as straight time.

Overtime should be approved in advance by your manager. Employees who work overtime without obtaining proper authorization may be subject to disciplinary action. Regardless of whether the overtime was approved or not, employees will be paid for all hours worked.

Non-exempt employees cannot waive overtime pay. However, if a supervisor wishes to give a non-exempt employee time off to make up for extra hours worked, time off must be given and used by the employee in the same work week.

# SECTION 6: APPEARANCE & PROFESSIONALISM

## on-stage.md

### On Stage

Guest perceptions matter—everything we do affects our guests. People love to people-watch, and our guests watch each of us. They watch the service, look at our cleanliness and sanitation practices, notice the behaviors and interactions of employees, and see other guests' reactions to what we do.

There isn't much that our guests' eyes will miss. This is why we say you are always "on stage" in front of guests. We are putting on a performance to create a fun and relaxing environment for our guests. The "part" requires that we're professional, upbeat, and friendly, whether we feel like it or not.

We are not here to drop food and beverages in front of people. We are here to build lasting relationships.
