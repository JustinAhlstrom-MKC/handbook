# Outside Employment

MKC Restaurants recognizes that some employees may hold jobs with other employers or engage in freelance work. While we do not prohibit outside employment, we expect that any additional work does not interfere with your responsibilities here.

## Expectations

If you have outside employment, you must:

- **Prioritize your scheduled shifts** - Your MKC schedule takes priority. Outside work is not a valid reason for calling out or being unavailable for scheduled shifts.
- **Maintain your performance** - Outside work should not affect your alertness, energy, or quality of work at MKC Restaurants.
- **Avoid conflicts of interest** - Do not work for a direct competitor in a way that could harm MKC Restaurants or create a conflict of loyalty.
- **Protect our confidential information** - Never share MKC recipes, business practices, or other confidential information with another employer.

## Disclosure

You are not required to disclose outside employment. However, if your outside work begins to affect your availability, performance, or creates a potential conflict of interest, please discuss it with your manager.

## Management Employees

Managers and employees in leadership roles should discuss any outside employment with ownership to ensure there are no conflicts with their responsibilities.

## Scheduling

We will work with you on scheduling when possible, but your availability for MKC shifts remains your responsibility. Frequent unavailability due to outside work may affect your scheduled hours.
