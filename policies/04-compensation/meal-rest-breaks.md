# Meal & Rest Breaks

MKC Restaurants values employee wellbeing and provides meal and rest breaks in compliance with Minnesota law (Minn. Stat. 177.253).

## Rest Breaks

Employees working 4 or more consecutive hours are entitled to at least one paid 15-minute rest break, including sufficient time to use the restroom, within each four-hour period of work. You do not need to clock out for rest breaks.

## Meal Breaks

Employees working 6 or more consecutive hours are entitled to a paid meal break of at least 30 minutes. The timing of your meal break will be determined by your manager based on business needs.

If you are unable to take your full meal break for any reason, notify your manager immediately.

Employees may voluntarily choose to waive a meal or rest break, but you will never be required or pressured to do so.

## Scheduling Breaks

Managers will work to ensure you receive your entitled breaks. Due to the nature of restaurant work, break times may vary based on business flow. If you are unable to take a break during your shift, inform your manager.

## Nursing Mothers

Nursing mothers are entitled to paid break time and a private space (not a restroom) to express breast milk for as long as the employee has the need. MKC Restaurants will not reduce your compensation for time used to express milk, and you will not face retaliation for requesting these breaks. See our [Reasonable Accommodations](../02-employment/accommodations.md) policy for additional details.
