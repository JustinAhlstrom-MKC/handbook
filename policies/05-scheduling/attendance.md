# Attendance Expectations

Fully staffed shifts are essential to our success. Prompt and regular attendance is a condition of employment for all employees. MKC Restaurants encourages and reinforces good attendance and punctuality.

**Managers are responsible for scheduling appropriate staffing levels. Team members are responsible for working every shift scheduled or finding adequate coverage. Everyone arrives on time and ready to serve our community.**

## Using 7shifts

We use 7shifts to manage scheduling. You are expected to:

- Set your recurring availability and note scheduling preferences in 7shifts
- Request time off at least 3 weeks ahead of time
- Understand that time off requests are not guaranteed
- Find coverage using the shift pool when you cannot work a scheduled shift
- Keep call-outs exceptionally rare

## Call-Out Procedures

When unable to report to work due to an illness or emergency, an employee must contact their manager directly as far in advance as possible prior to their next scheduled shift, or in the event of an emergency, as soon as practical. Contacting a co-worker is not acceptable. Employees should call in regularly, or as instructed by their manager, each day during an unplanned absence.
