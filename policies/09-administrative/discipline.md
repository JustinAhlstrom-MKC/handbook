# Discipline

MKC Restaurants expects employees to use good judgment at all times. While we don't relish the idea of discipline, sometimes it is necessary.

## Disciplinary Actions

Discipline may include any of the following, depending on the severity of the issue and the circumstances:

- Verbal coaching or counseling
- Written warning
- Suspension
- Termination

MKC Restaurants reserves the right to determine the appropriate level of discipline for any situation. **Because employment is at-will, any step may be skipped, repeated, or combined based on the circumstances.** There is no requirement that discipline follow a particular sequence.

## Examples

The following are examples of conduct that may result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination. This list is not exhaustive:

- Attendance or punctuality issues
- Failure to follow policies, procedures, or manager instructions
- Poor job performance
- Insubordination
- Conduct that is unsafe, dishonest, or disruptive
- Violation of the substance-free workplace, harassment, or other conduct policies
- Unauthorized use or disclosure of confidential information

Some conduct is serious enough to warrant immediate termination without prior warnings, including but not limited to theft, violence, working under the influence, and harassment.

## Documentation

Disciplinary actions may be documented and placed in your personnel file. You have the right to review your personnel file and submit a written response to any disciplinary documentation, as described in the [Personnel Files](personnel-files.md) policy.
