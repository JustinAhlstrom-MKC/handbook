# Introductory Period

The first 90 days of employment are considered an introductory period. This time allows you to learn about MKC Restaurants, your responsibilities, and our expectations. It also gives us an opportunity to evaluate your performance and fit with our team.

## During the Introductory Period

During this time, you will:

- Complete all required training and onboarding
- Learn our systems (TOAST, 7shifts, ADP)
- Demonstrate your ability to perform your job duties
- Show that you can work effectively with our team and serve our guests

## Expectations

We expect all new team members to:

- Arrive on time and ready to work for every scheduled shift
- Be open to feedback and coaching
- Ask questions when you're unsure
- Demonstrate our core values: Be Honest, Be Kind, Achieve Results

## Completion of Introductory Period

Successful completion of the introductory period is not a guarantee of continued employment. Employment remains at-will throughout your time with MKC Restaurants.

After 90 days:
- You become eligible to use accrued Sick & Safe Time
- If you've averaged 30+ hours per week, you begin accruing PTO
- You remain eligible for any applicable benefits as outlined in our policies

## Extensions

In some cases, the introductory period may be extended if additional time is needed to evaluate performance or complete required training.
