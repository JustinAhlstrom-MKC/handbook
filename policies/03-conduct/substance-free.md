# Substance-Free Workplace

Employees are not allowed to be under the influence of drugs or alcohol while working. Employees exhibiting signs of being under the influence of drugs or alcohol while working will be subject to immediate discipline, up to and including termination.

There is no tolerance for drinking or using other drugs while working. Working while impaired is unsafe and does not enable us to provide great guest experiences.

MKC Restaurants does not conduct drug or alcohol testing. Discipline is based on observed behavior and work performance.
