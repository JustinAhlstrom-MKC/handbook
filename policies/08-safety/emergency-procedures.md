# Emergency Procedures

The safety of our employees and guests is our top priority. Emergency procedures — including fire evacuation, severe weather shelter, medical emergencies, and security incidents — are posted at each location. Familiarize yourself with these procedures and the location of emergency exits, fire extinguishers, and first aid kits.

For fire-specific procedures, including kitchen fire response, extinguisher use, and evacuation, see the [Fire Safety](fire-safety.md) policy.

If you have questions about emergency procedures at your location, ask your manager.
