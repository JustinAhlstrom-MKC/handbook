# Harassment Policy

MKC Restaurants fosters a respectful workplace. We want every employee to treat each other and every guest with respect, even where disagreements may exist. You are free to complain, express frustrations, and disagree, but you must do so respectfully. It is the responsibility of every manager and employee to be respectful.

Harassment is not respectful. Harassment is also against the law. Harassment that is based on an individual's age, race, color, gender, gender identity, religion, national origin, disability (mental or physical) status, marital or familial status, sexual orientation, pregnancy, protected military or veteran status, genetic information, or any other characteristic protected by law will not be tolerated.

Sexual harassment is also prohibited under this policy and under federal and many state and local laws. Sexual harassment includes sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, and other verbal or physical conduct involving sex. Even though a comment or conduct does not express a sexual desire, comments or conduct may still be sexual harassment.

Harassment is defined as conduct or comments that have the purpose or effect of interfering with an individual's employment. The comments or conduct that could be harassment include:

- Slurs, epithets, or insults
- Sexual comments and conversations
- Demeaning or belittling comments or jokes
- Displays of offensive or demeaning images, cartoons, or stories
- Threatening adverse employment actions if sexual favors are not granted or promising preferential treatment in return for sexual favors

MKC Restaurants considers this conduct to be misconduct and will discipline employees who engage in this conduct. The discipline may include termination.

## Manager Responsibilities

Managers are responsible to prevent and stop harassment. Managers are required to be aware of this policy, refrain from harassment, and inform Justin as soon as they suspect or become aware of an allegation of harassment. If a manager is aware of harassment and does not report the conduct, the manager will be disciplined.

## Please Tell Us

MKC Restaurants takes allegations of harassment seriously. We encourage applicants and employees to tell any manager if they believe they have been harassed or have witnessed harassment. You may contact them in any manner you feel most comfortable, including via phone, email, in-person discussion, or letter.

MKC Restaurants will keep allegations of harassment as confidential as possible. Only those individuals who need to know will know. That said, it may not be possible to keep all allegations confidential as an investigation and action may be necessary.

## Investigation

When we learn of potential harassment, MKC Restaurants will take appropriate action to stop the conduct. This includes conducting an investigation to learn more about the comments or conduct from those employees or other individuals involved. An investigation may include interviewing individuals, examining various technologies (including email, cell phone, and text records), and reviewing policies. Following the investigation, you will be told of the outcome.
